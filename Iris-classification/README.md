# Iris Species Classification
In this project, I have used Logistic Regression to classify Iris species.
In Iris dataset there are three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower.
The columns in this dataset are:

- Id
- SepalLengthCm
- SepalWidthCm
- PetalLengthCm
- PetalWidthCm
- Species
